    "recommendation": "The algorithm selected Candidate 1 (overall score 67) as the best match for this Medical/Surgical RN role. While no candidate is a perfect plug-and-play, Candidate 1’s combination of advanced education, extensive acute-care leadership and regulatory expertise, and demonstrated quality-and-safety focus give them an edge over the others.\n\n1. Key Strengths and Qualifications  \n • Education: Holds both a BSN and an MSN—exceeds the preferred BSN requirement, signaling advanced clinical knowledge and a commitment to professional development.  \n • Clinical-Operational Experience: 17 years in varied nursing roles, including floor-staff supervision, case management, infection control and EMR workflow optimization. This breadth shows deep familiarity with hospital processes, quality assurance and patient-safety standards.  \n • Regulatory & Quality Expertise: Proven track record in root-cause analysis, compliance audits and policy implementation—critical for maintaining standards in a busy Med/Surg unit.  \n • Leadership & Communication: Supervisory roles and training responsibilities indicate strong teamwork, mentoring ability and clear communication—essential for interdisciplinary collaboration and patient/family education.\n\n2. Alignment With Critical Job Requirements  \n • Acute Care Experience: Extensive work in acute-care environments, though some roles are administrative, suggests a strong foundation in patient assessment, monitoring and care planning.  \n • BSN Preferred & RN License: Meets and exceeds educational preferences; likely holds a current RN license.  \n • Soft Skills: Attention to detail, critical thinking and leadership directly map to the responsibilities of medication/treatment administration, documentation, and complex care coordination.\n\n3. Unique Differentiators  \n • Master’s-level perspective on quality and safety drives continuous improvement, which can elevate unit performance and patient outcomes.  \n • Infection control mastery is a high‐value skill in today’s regulatory climate—an area not as strongly represented in Candidates 2 or 3.  \n • Broad EMR implementation experience, even if not specifically Epic, means fewer ramp-up challenges when learning new systems.\n\n4. Comparison to Other Top Candidates  \n • Candidate 2 (score 60) has solid acute and emergency bedside skills but holds only an ADN, lacks a BSN, and does not list BLS/ACLS or Epic-type EHR experience.  \n • Candidate 3 (score 52) brings strong home-care and compliance know-how but has no documented Med/Surg or telemetry unit practice, and their degree is not nursing-specific.\n\n5. Remaining Gaps & Recommended Next Steps  \n • Certifications: Confirm current BLS and ACLS; encourage CMSRN pursuit.  \n • Bedside Med/Surg Detail: Probe recent hands-on Med/Surg and any telemetry floor time.  \n • EHR Proficiency: Evaluate transferable EMR skills and plan for Epic-system training.  \n\nRecommendation  \nProceed with Candidate 1 for a behavioral and technical interview to verify bedside Med/Surg experience, licensure/certifications and EHR capabilities. Their advanced education, deep acute-care and regulatory background, and leadership skills make them the strongest overall match for this RN opening."
