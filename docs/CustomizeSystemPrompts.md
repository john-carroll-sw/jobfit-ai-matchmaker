# Modifying System Processing Prompts

System prompts are used for processing steps in the pipeline. These system prompts are located in this folder of the repository:
> [/src/libs/pipeline/handlers/map_handler.py](/src/libs/pipeline/handlers/map_handler.py)

Schema specific prompts are managed directly in the individual schema .py file that is created.
